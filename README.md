Emotion perception refers to the capacities and abilities of recognizing and identifying emotions in others.

Emotion can be perceived visually, audibly, through textual means, etc.

The natural variation in humanâ€™s emotion requires the classification algorithm to distinguish the smaller features from the large pool of input features. 

Analyzing and computing such behavior is achieved through Reinforced Learning, which allows the system to make calculated decisions. 

Hence the motivation to develop a unified platform for different emotional analysis by learning through the inputs every time that runs using a single UI.

The goal of the proposed system is to bring textual as well as visual emotions recognition under a single platform.

It also aims to work in offline mode with an integrated hardware Raspberry Pi with a camera module used for visual emotion.
